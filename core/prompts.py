keyword_extraction_prompt = '''
You are an OSINT investigator.

Your task is to extract *distinctive authorial fingerprints* from the text below—unusual or identifying keywords and short phrases that can help locate other articles by the same person via web search.

Return exactly {num_keywords} short (1–3 word) distinctive, **author-specific or author-typical** terms.

Prioritize:
- Colloquial language, slang, Singlish, or stylistic quirks
- Emotionally charged or opinionated vocabulary
- Repeated niche phrases or metaphors used by the author
- Rare idioms or invented phrasing
- Region- or subculture-specific acronyms, names, or references

Avoid:
- Technical terms or domain jargon (e.g. “real GDP per capita”, “neoliberalism”) unless used in an unusual way
- Concepts or terms commonly found on Wikipedia or academic websites
- Generic, broad, or emotionally neutral words
- Full sentences or explanations

Think: What would this author say that *few others would?*

Output format:
Return a valid JSON object in the following format:

{{
  "keywords": [
    "keyword1",
    "keyword2",
    "keyword3"
  ]
}}



ARTICLE:

process_into_list_prompt = '''
You will be given a string that contains a list of items. The list may include newline characters, bullet points (e.g. `-` or `•`), or inconsistent spacing.

Your task is to extract and return a clean **Python list** of strings, with each item stripped of any bullet characters and whitespace.

Return only valid JSON output. For example, given the input:

'- abc  \n - def ghi'

Return:
["abc", "def ghi"]

Input string:
{{input_string}}

website_ideation_sys_prompt = '''
You are a digital OSINT analyst.

Given an article and a list of keywords that reflect the author's unique style or language, your task is to suggest relevant websites or platforms where searching these keywords might help find **more writings by the same author**.

Output format:
Return a valid JSON object in the following format:

{{
  "sites": [
    "site:reddit.com",
    "site:medium.com",
    "site:twitter.com"
  ]
}}

Focus on:
- Blogs, personal domains, and writing platforms (e.g., Medium, Wordpress, Substack)
- Forums and community sites (e.g., Reddit, HardwareZone)
- Social platforms (e.g., Twitter/X, Facebook)
- Niche communities depending on the article content

Do not explain. Just return the JSON object.

author_checker_prompt = '''
You are an assistant helping verify whether a person authored any content in a screenshot.

Target author: "{author}"

Follow these steps:

1. Read the image text carefully.
2. Check if "{author}" appears **exactly** as the author of any content — such as:
   - A visible username or handle next to a post
   - A byline, reply tag, or attribution explicitly showing authorship

3. Do **not** guess or infer based on similar names. Only confirm if it **exactly matches** "{author}".

Return only:
- "yes" — if "{author}" is clearly shown as an author
- "no" — if not

No extra explanation.

author_content_extraction_prompt = '''
You are a data extraction assistant helping an OSINT analyst identify and structure content written by a specific individual from a screenshot containing text.

Your goal is to extract only the content explicitly authored by the person named "{author}". The text may come from forums, blogs, social media, comment sections, or other platforms.

Follow these steps carefully:

1. **Check if the name "{author}" appears anywhere in the text** — as a username, handle, author tag, or attribution label. Do not infer or assume — only proceed if there is clear textual evidence of this name.

2. If "{author}" is found, identify all the text **directly attributed** to them. This may include:
   - Posts or comments where "{author}" is clearly shown as the author
   - Replies or messages labeled as coming from "{author}"

3. Extract only their content, **excluding anything written by others**.

4. If no content from "{author}" is found, return an **empty list**.

Always return your output as a **valid JSON object** in this exact format:

**If content is found:**
{{
  "content": [
    "First piece of content written by {author}.",
    "Second piece of content written by {author}."
  ]
}}

**If no content is found:**
{{
  "content": []
}}
